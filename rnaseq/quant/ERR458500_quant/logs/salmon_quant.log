[2023-03-10 05:38:37.030] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1,574,506 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-03-10 05:38:37.154] [jointLog] [warning] 5.30602e-05% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 26.
