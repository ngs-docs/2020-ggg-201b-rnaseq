[2023-03-10 05:44:05.208] [jointLog] [info] Counted 1,571,516 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2023-03-10 05:44:05.254] [jointLog] [warning] 0.000320875% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
